Further, the theory of MHWT is implemented to obtain the Mexican hat wavelet Stieltjes transform (MHWST) of a bounded variation function. Some convenient properties of MHWST are also presented. Further, a standard method is introduced for representing functions of class B(m, n). Besides, an integral transform is constructed with the help of the Fourier summation kernel. This construction results in a flexible way to present some conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a function of class B(m, n) to be Mexican hat wavelet and MHWST.}

	%abstract = {This paper discusses a family of filters that have been designed for Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) Banks. These filters provide a significant improvement over conventional optimal equiripple and window designs when used in QMF banks. The performance criterion for these filters differ from those usually used for filter design in a way which makes the usual filter design techniques difficult to apply. Two filters are actually designed simultaneously, with constraints on the stop band rejection, transition band width, and pass and transition band performance of the QMF filter structure made from those filters. Unlike most filter design problems, the behavior of the transition band is constrained, which places unusual requirements on the design algorithm. The requirement that the overall passband behavior of the QMF bank be constrained (which is a function of the passband and stop band behavior of the filter) also places very unusual requirements on the filter design. The filters were designed using a Hooke and Jeaves optimization routine with a Hanning window prototype. Theoretical results suggest that exactly flat frequency designs cannot be created for filter lengths greater than 2, however, using the discussed procedure, one can obtain QMF banks with as little as ±.0015dB ripple in their frequency response. Due to the nature of QMF filter applications, a small set of filters can be derived which will fit most applications.}

	%abstract = {The paper presents considerations concerning the transfer of random errors from the input to the output of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) algorithm. The concept of determining an uncertainty of its output data based on the probabilistic error description has been presented. The DWT is discussed as the product of the vector of input quantities and the matrix of algorithm coefficients. Calculations of the uncertainty of a single output result of the algorithm are described with assumption that the input quantities are burdened by random errors of known distributions. Theoretical considerations have been verified by simulation experiments using the Monte Carlo method. Determining the uncertainty at the DWT output is possible due to the specific properties of transferring random errors by linear and additive algorithms.}

In this paper, an uncertainty propagation method is developed for problems in which multimodal probability density functions are involved. Firstly, the multimodal probability density functions of input random variables are established using the Gaussian mixture model. Secondly, the uncertainties of the input random variables are propagated to the response function through an integration of the sparse grid numerical method and maximum entropy method. Finally, the convergence mechanism is developed to improve the uncertainty propagation accuracy step by step. Two numerical examples and one engineering application are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

The new scheme was based on approximate entropy (ApEn) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) analysis of EEG signals. Seizure detection was accomplished in two stages. In the first stage, EEG signals were decomposed into approximation and detail coefficients using DWT. In the second stage, ApEn values of the approximation and detail coefficients were computed. Significant differences were found between the ApEn values of the epileptic and the normal EEG allowing us to detect seizures with over 96% accuracy. Without DWT as preprocessing step, it was shown that the detection rate was reduced to 73%. The analysis results depicted that during seizure activity EEG had lower ApEn values compared to normal EEG. This suggested that epileptic EEG was more predictable or less complex than the normal EEG. The data was further analyzed with surrogate data analysis methods to test for evidence of nonlinearities. It was shown that epileptic EEG had significant nonlinearity whereas normal EEG behaved similar to Gaussian linear stochastic process.}

Results of this type are the subject of the following article. Among else, the following will be shown: if ψ is a window function, f ∈ L2(R) \ 0 an arbitrary signal and Gψ f (ω, t) the continuous Gabor transform of f with respect to ψ, then the support of Gψ f (ω, t) considered as a subset of the time-frequency-plane R2 cannot possess finite Lebesgue measure. The proof of this statement, as well as the proof of its wavelet counterpart, relies heavily on the well known fact that the ranges of the continuous transforms are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, showing some kind of shift-invariance. The last point prohibits the extension of results of this type to discrete theory.}

	%abstract = {In this work, we propose the construction of two-channel wavelet filter banks for analyzing functions defined on the vertices of any arbitrary finite weighted undirected graph. These graph based functions are referred to as graph-signals as we build a framework in which many concepts from the classical signal processing domain, such as Fourier decomposition, signal filtering and downsampling can be extended to graph domain. Especially, we observe a spectral folding phenomenon in bipartite graphs which occurs during downsampling of these graphs and produces aliasing in graph signals. This property of bipartite graphs, allows us to design critically sampled two-channel filter banks, and we propose quadrature mirror filters (referred to as graph-QMF) for bipartite graph which cancel aliasing and lead to perfect reconstruction. For arbitrary graphs we present a bipartite subgraph decomposition which produces an edge-disjoint collection of bipartite subgraphs. Graph-QMFs are then constructed on each bipartite subgraph leading to “multi-dimensional” separable wavelet filter banks on graphs. Our proposed filter banks are critically sampled and we state necessary and sufficient conditions for orthogonality, aliasing cancellation and perfect reconstruction. The filter banks are realized by Chebychev polynomial approximations.}

	%abstract = {The JPEG2000 image coding standard employs the biorthogonal 9/7 wavelet for lossy compression. The performance of a hardware implementation of the 9/7 filter bank depends on the accuracy and the efficiency with which the quantized filter coefficients are represented. A high-precision representation ensures compression performance close to the unquantized, infinite precision filter bank, but at the cost of increased hardware resources and processing time. If the filter coefficients are quantized such that the filter bank properties are preserved, then, the degradation in compression performance will be minimal. This paper investigates two filter structures and two "compensating" filter coefficient quantization methods for improving the performance of multiplierless, quantized filter banks. Rather than using an optimization technique to guide the design process, the new methods utilizes the perfect reconstruction requirements of the filter bank. The results indicate that the best method (a cascade structure with compensating zeros) realizes image-compression performance very similar to the unquantized filter case while also achieving a fast, efficient hardware implementation.}

Our fundamental constraint is that the scaling functions should reproduce a predefined set of exponential polynomials. This allows one to tune the corresponding wavelet transform to a specific class of signals, thereby ensuring good approximation and sparsity properties. The main difference with the classical construction of Daubechies is that the multiresolution spaces are derived from scale-dependent generating functions. However, from an algorithmic standpoint, Mallat's fast wavelet transform algorithm can still be applied; the only adaptation consists in using scale-dependent filter banks. Finite support ensures the same computational efficiency as in the classical case. We characterize the scaling and wavelet filters, construct them and show several examples of the associated functions. We prove that these functions are square-integrable and that they converge to their classical counterparts of the corresponding order.}

Lifting based wavelet transforms considered are 5/3 and 9/7. Wide range of images, including both color and gray scale images were considered. These wavelet transforms are used to compress the test images competitively by using Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) algorithm and by incorporating lifting concepts. Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees is a new advanced algorithm based on wavelet transform which is gaining attention due to many potential commercial applications in the area of image compression. These algorithms resulted in practical advantages, such as, superior low bit rate performance, bit-level compression, progressive transmission by pixel, accuracy and resolution .The SPIHT coder is also a highly refined version of the EZW algorithm and is a powerful image compression algorithm, that produces an embedded bit stream form, in which the best reconstructed images shows a significant perceptual improvement as well as an increased PSNR.}

In this paper, most important tests related to noise and effective resolution, nonlinearity, environmental uncertainty, and stability are proved and validated in the specific case of a high-performance ΔΣ ADC. In particular, tests setups are proposed and discussed and the definitions used to assess the performance are clearly stated in order to identify procedures and guidelines for high-resolution ADCs characterization. An experimental case study of the high-performance ΔΣ ADC DS-22 developed at CERN is reported and discussed by presenting effective alternative test setups. Experimental results show that common characterization methods by the IEEE standards 1241 [1] and 1057 [2] cannot be used and alternative strategies turn out to be effective.}

Their applicability was verified using degree of scalogram density on synthetic and operational signals. Results of the analysis of B-spline family wavelets show that proposed approach gives more accurate results in comparison with other chosen wavelets and can be applied in industrial diagnostics.}

	%abstract = {This paper introduces the double-density dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is a DWT that combines the double-density DWT and the dual-tree DWT, each of which has its own characteristics and advantages. The transform corresponds to a new family of dyadic wavelet tight frames based on two scaling functions and four distinct wavelets. One pair of the four wavelets are designed to be offset from the other pair of wavelets so that the integer translates of one wavelet pair fall midway between the integer translates of the other pair. Simultaneously, one pair of wavelets are designed to be approximate Hilbert transforms of the other pair of wavelets so that two complex (approximately analytic) wavelets can be formed. Therefore, they can be used to implement complex and directional wavelet transforms. The paper develops a design procedure to obtain finite impulse response (FIR) filters that satisfy the numerous constraints imposed. This design procedure employs a fractional-delay allpass filter, spectral factorization, and filterbank completion. The solutions have vanishing moments, compact support, a high degree of smoothness, and are nearly shift-invariant.}

A neural network, which is one of the components of a measurement signal processing chain, represents a specific type of a transducer, and therefore there is a need to determine the uncertainty of the results obtained by the network. Determination of this uncertainty is necessary for the purpose of comparing the metrological properties of neural networks of different structures, learned using different algorithms, as well as for comparing the classical and neural data processing methods that allow obtaining sufficiently accurate measurement results. This study presents a method for uncertainty estimation which is based on the histogram of neural network output result errors obtained in the testing process. The method allows determining the width of the uncertainty interval of final results for a given level of confidence. The theoretical considerations are complemented by simulation results of the measuring chain which uses neural networks for reconstruction of the input signal of a non-linear sensor.}

	%abstract = {Wavelet Transform (WT) is one of the most important signal processing methods that is being widely used in structural health monitoring (SHM). The primary advantage of WT over other signal processing techniques is the ability to extract and analyze information in both time and frequency domain with adaptive resolutions. However, in most of the applications, measurements are highly contaminated with noise from numerous sources, and the noise contamination will accumulate and propagate through the wavelet transformation. The WT outcome, referred to as wavelet coefficients, will be degraded and the features extracted from the contaminated coefficients will cause misinterpretation and false decisions. In this paper, probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ) for wavelet coefficients is investigated to facilitate more meaningful data processing for reliable decision-making. The proposed approach is able to estimate the variance of the wavelet coefficients at different scales and shift values which leads to an estimated probability density function (PDF) that can be used later to improve decision making procedure. A probabilistic analytical framework for quantifying the uncertainty of the wavelet transform estimation is proposed in this context, and the results are validated using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) on simulated signals and systems as well as experimental signals recorded from a vibration structure. The adopted framework is generic to all kinds of WT with different mother wavelets.}

	%abstract = {Monte Carlo analysis has become nearly ubiquitous since its introduction, now over 65 years ago. It is an important tool in many assessments of the reliability and robustness of systems, structures or solutions. As the deterministic core simulation can be lengthy, the computational costs of Monte Carlo can be a limiting factor. To reduce that computational expense as much as possible, sampling efficiency and convergence for Monte Carlo are investigated in this paper. The first section shows that non-collapsing space-filling sampling strategies, illustrated here with the maximin and uniform Latin hypercube designs, highly enhance the sampling efficiency, and render a desired level of accuracy of the outcomes attainable with far lesser runs. In the second section it is demonstrated that standard sampling statistics are inapplicable for Latin hypercube strategies. A sample-splitting approach is put forward, which in combination with a replicated Latin hypercube sampling allows assessing the accuracy of Monte Carlo outcomes. The assessment in turn permits halting the Monte Carlo simulation when the desired levels of accuracy are reached. Both measures form fairly noncomplex upgrades of the current state-of-the-art in Monte-Carlo based uncertainty analysis but give a substantial further progress with respect to its applicability.}

Using this algorithm, we also develop an iterative algorithm to estimate a signal from its modified STFT magnitude. The iterative algorithm is shown to decrease, in each iteration, the mean squared error between the STFT magnitude of the estimated signal and the modified STFT magnitude. The major computation involved in the iterative algorithm is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) computation, and the algorithm appears to be real-time implementable with current hardware technology. The algorithm developed in this paper has been applied to the time-scale modification of speech. The resulting system generates very high-quality speech, and appears to be better in performance than any existing method.}

It is typically defined as the “number of cycles,” but this parameter is opaque, and often leads to uncertainty and suboptimal analysis choices, as well as being difficult to interpret and evaluate. The purpose of this paper is to present alternative formulations of Morlet wavelets in time and in frequency that allow parameterizing the wavelets directly in terms of the desired temporal and spectral smoothing (expressed as full-width at half-maximum).
